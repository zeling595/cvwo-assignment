I'm unable to finish this app and I manage to perform read and delete actions. I learn the basic of react and rails, how to use 'antd' UI framework and partially ajax.

I enjoyed the learning process. However, being inexperience with app design, I wasted a lot of time on learning insignificant knowledge. As a result of lack of systematic understanding, I was not able to fully understand the errors. 

(Would like to re-learn app development and finish it during Summer holiday.)
